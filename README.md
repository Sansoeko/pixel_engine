## Building
Make sure you've got MSVC installed (comes with Visual Studio C++)

Then just `call build_scratch.bat` **WITH** your environment variables initialised.

You can initialise them via `call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"` (or whatever your actual path is)
